A greenfoot project of chess. Final assignment for UMS TIF3221307 Visual
Programming course.

This greenfoot chess game is very much playable. It implements basic piece move
analysis based off of the standard chess rules in order to determine legal
moves (e.g. can't move into check). Though there are special cases like en passant
and castling that hasn't been implemented (yet).

There's also board flipping on different turns, this setting can be toggled
on/off in the `ChessGame.java` file (specifically the `ENABLE_FLIPPING_TURNS`
final static variable).

To-Do list:

  [ ] Implement en passant
  [ ] Implement castling
  [ ] Add a timer
  [ ] Piece movement animation
  [ ] Drag-and-drop for piece movement
  [ ] Add sounds

Had a lot of fun writing this project :)
